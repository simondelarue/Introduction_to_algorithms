# Python implementation of algorithms from "Introduction to algorithms (4th edition)" 

I implement some of the algorithms in [Introduction to algorithms (4th edition)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-fourth-edition) (*Thomas H. Cormen et al.*, 2022) in Python.

Each folder corresponds to a chapter in the text book. Within each chapter, algorithms are implemented in different Python files.
